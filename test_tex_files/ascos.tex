% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\begin{abstract}

Discovering similar objects in a social network has many interesting issues.  Here, we present ASCOS, an Asymmetric
Structure COntext Similarity measure that captures the similarity scores among
any pairs of nodes in a network.  The definition of ASCOS is similar to that of the
well-known SimRank since both define score values recursively.  However, we
show that ASCOS outputs a more complete similarity score than SimRank because
SimRank (and several of its variations, such as P-Rank and SimFusion) on average
ignores half paths between nodes during calculation.  To make ASCOS
tractable in both computation time and memory usage, we propose two variations
of ASCOS: a low rank approximation based approach and an iterative solver Gauss-Seidel for
linear equations.  When the target network is sparse, the run time
and the required computing space of these variations are smaller than
computing SimRank and ASCOS directly.  In addition, the iterative solver divides
the original network into several independent sub-systems so that a multi-core
server or a distributed computing environment, such as MapReduce, can
efficiently solve the problem.
We compare the performance of ASCOS with other global structure based similarity
measures, including SimRank, Katz, and LHN.  The experimental results based on
user evaluation suggest that ASCOS gives better results than other measures.
In addition, the asymmetric property has the potential to identify the hierarchical
structure of a network.  Finally, variations of ASCOS (including one
distributed variation) can also
reduce computation both in space and time.
